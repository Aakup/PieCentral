## What is the Central Repo?
 - The PiE Central Repo is our main central repository that contains a bunch of other PiE repositories, including...
 
     - Hibike, our lightweight communications protocol designed for the passing of sensor data for the PiE Robotics Kit
     - Dawn, our cross-platform frontend for the PiE robotics control system
     - Atalanta, the runtime code in our beaglebones
     - Protos, our protocol buffers used by Dawn and runtime
     - DevOps, which oversees axiom, frankfurter, and chrommunal
    
    ***Note that Hibike and Dawn are currently using the develop branch***

### If you want to learn more about these repositories, check out their directories!

### A note to contributers:
    
 - You don't have to fork! Instead, make your own branch in the central repo. 

 - Also, when you are making your branch, make sure to follow this naming convention:
   
   **your_name/feature_name**


 - feel free to split the project further with more slashes
